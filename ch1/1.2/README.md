# Exercise 1.2

1. Compute how many seconds in 42 minutes 42 seconds

	 42 * 60 + 42 = 2562

2. Compute how many miles in 10 km

	10 / 1.61 = 6.21

3. In order
	1. Average pace (time per mile)
	
		(60 * 42 + 42) / (10 / 1.61) = 412.482 s/mile = 6 m 52.482 s
	
	2. Average speed in miles per hour

		((60 * 42 + 42) / (10 / 1.61))**-1 * 60 * 60 = 8.728 mi/h
